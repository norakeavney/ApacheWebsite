	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</a> (born 8 June 
	1955), also known as TimBL, is an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor
	of the  <b>World Wide Web </b>. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,
	and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
	client and server via the internet in mid-November the same year. </p>

	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Berners-Lee</a> is the director of 
	the <b>World Wide Web </b> Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web.
	He is also the founder of the  <b>World Wide Web </b> Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of 
	the founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
	He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board 
	of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of 
	trustees of the Ford Foundation. In 2004, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">
	Berners-Lee</a> was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. </p>


	<p>In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. 
	Named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Berners-Lee</a>
	has received a number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor of the 
	 <b>World Wide Web </b>" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in 
	person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium. He tweeted "This is 
	for everyone", which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 
	people in the audience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Berners-Lee</a>
	received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the <b>World Wide Web</b>, 
	the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to 
	scale".</p>

	<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
	<hr style="width:50% height:30px">
	<p><b>World Wide Web</b> (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents 
	and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by 
	hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee </a> invented the 
	<b>World Wide Web</b> in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while 
	employed at <a href="https://home.cern/about" target="_blank">CERN</a> in Switzerland. The Web browser was released 
	outside of <a href="https://home.cern/about" target="_blank">CERN </a>in 1991, first to 
	other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in 
	August 1991</p>

	<p>The <b>World Wide Web</b>has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the 
	primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet. Web pages are primarily text 
	documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to 
	formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are 
	rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.</p>

	<p>Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a 
	common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can largely 
	be provided by the publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the content 
	depends upon the users or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for 
	entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisational 
	purposes.</p>
